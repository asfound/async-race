# Async Race

Async Race is a single-page application for managing a collection of cars, controlling their engines, and tracking races. Users can perform full CRUD operations on cars, specifying their names and colors, and control car engines with smooth start/stop animations. The race controls include the ability to start and reset a race. The Winners view offers sorting and pagination by the number of wins and best race times. The interface is fully responsive down to screen widths of 500px. The app uses a ready-made backend server provided separately.
